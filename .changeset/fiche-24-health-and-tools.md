Add the "Santé" and "Outils" admin screens (fiche 24), maintenance mode, and a bounded server error journal.

- `@cogenta/core`: adds `createErrorLog`, a bounded, redacted ring buffer for the last N server errors — the admin's substitute for reading `stdout` on a host with no access to the process.
- `@cogenta/schema`: adds `createMaintenanceStore`/`ensureMaintenanceTable` (a one-row on/off switch with a visitor-facing message) and exports `reindexAll`/`reindexEntry` from the search indexer, so a full rebuild reuses exactly what the write path already does on save.
- `@cogenta/api`: adds `createHealthRouter` (`GET /api/health-report` — literally `cogenta doctor`'s own report, over HTTP; migrations status/apply; audit chain integrity; disk usage; the error log; maintenance mode get/set) and `createToolsRouter` (`GET /api/tools`, `POST /api/tools/{id}/run`, `GET /api/tools/runs[/…]` — seven maintenance tools, always queued, never run inline in the request). Adds a `pending-migrations` notice source.
- `@cogenta/cli`: `cogenta serve` wires all of the above — `runDoctor` reused unchanged, migrations applied only up to the first destructive one (the CLI is named for the rest), the seven tools (purge caches, reindex search/vectors, regenerate image variants, check links, test email, purge expired trash) running through the existing database-queue driver's degraded tier, and a maintenance-mode gate that serves an uncacheable 503 with a wait page to every anonymous visitor while `/api/*` and `/admin*` stay reachable.

Purely additive: `createRequestListener`'s new third parameter is optional, and every `AssembleSiteOptions` addition is optional — a caller that builds a `Site` by hand, or does not pass a migrator, keeps working unchanged.
