## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d72b40f`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/d72b40f64ab5b98985a22d9daae34796a4638f45) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Self-hosted, cookie-free page-view analytics — the one CMS feature category
  the audit found completely missing. No third party, no cookie, no personal
  data ever stored, consistent with R1 (no dure dependency on external
  infrastructure) and the project's privacy stance.
  
  **New package `@cogenta/analytics`.** One table (`cogenta_analytics_events`):
  timestamp, page path, referring **domain only** (never the full referrer
  URL), a device category reduced from the User-Agent (`desktop`/`mobile`/
  `tablet`/`other`, never the raw string), and a **daily-salted session hash**
  — never an IP address, never a cookie. The salt (`cogenta_analytics_daily_salts`)
  is minted once per UTC day and rotates every day, so
  `sha256(salt|ip|device)` for the same real visitor is a *different*, unrelated
  value on every new day: nothing in the stored data can link two days of the
  same visitor's traffic, even with full database access, because reproducing
  yesterday's hash needs yesterday's IP, which was never written down. The IP
  address and the full User-Agent are used only as transient inputs to that
  hash and to the device classifier — neither is ever persisted. A dedicated
  privacy test suite (`test/privacy.test.ts`) inspects the actual stored
  columns, not just the public types, to prove this. `createAnalyticsStore`
  aggregates views by day, top pages, top referring domains and device
  breakdown; a same-session rate limit (60 events/minute) drops abusive
  traffic silently rather than erroring.
  
  **`@cogenta/core`** gains one error code, `ANALYTICS_SALT_UNAVAILABLE`
  (an internal race-recovery failure, not expected in normal operation).
  
  **`@cogenta/api`** gains `createAnalyticsRouter`: `GET /api/analytics/beacon`
  (public, records one event, always answers `204` even on a malformed or
  rate-limited request — a public collection endpoint must never break page
  rendering) and `GET /api/analytics/summary` (`admin`-only, `?days=` window).
  
  **`@cogenta/cli`** wires both into `cogenta serve` and injects the collection
  tag into every rendered page. The tag is an invisible `<img>` pixel, not a
  `<script>`: the theme's rendered output already carries a hard "zero
  executable client JavaScript" property (enforced by a `serve.test.ts`
  assertion), so a script reading `document.referrer` was not an option. The
  referrer is instead read **server-side**, from the `Referer` header of the
  request that is rendering the page, and baked straight into the pixel's URL
  — no client code needed to capture it. The page builder's live-preview
  render includes the same pixel (rather than omitting it) specifically to
  keep its `<body>` byte-identical to the published page's, the invariant
  `theme-render-fidelity` depends on.
  
  The admin gains a full `/analytics` dashboard (hand-built SVG bar chart, no
  charting dependency — R9) and a "views this week" widget on the main
  dashboard, both `admin`-only like every other traffic-shaped view in the
  admin.
