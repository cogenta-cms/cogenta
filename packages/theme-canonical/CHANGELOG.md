### Minor Changes

- [`edf5623`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/edf562389652c4f6afb58d6e3f166de233d063e2) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Fiche 15 — comments (ADR-0025, new contract F, `comments@1.0`):
  
  - **New package `@cogenta/comments`**: the comment model and store
    (`CommentStore`) — plain-text body only (R3: no HTML tags accepted, ever),
    hashed IP (never stored in clear, RGPD), moderation status
    (`pending`/`approved`/`spam`/`trash`), threading via `parentId`,
    `provenance`. A reversible migration (`ensureCommentsTables`/
    `dropCommentsTables`), tested up/down/up on SQLite; Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB
    integration tests are written (`test/integration/tables.test.ts`) but not
    executed this session (no local Docker). `createCommentsRouter` is the
    CMS's first public write route (`POST /api/comments`, no actor required)
    plus the admin moderation queue, both behind contract F's own permission
    vocabulary (`comments.read`/`moderate`/`reply`/`purge`/`settings`, distinct
    from contract A's five frozen actions). The public route enforces, from
    day one: rate limiting by IP and by target (`createCommentRateLimiter`),
    a honeypot field, a minimum fill-delay, non-AI spam heuristics
    (`checkSpamHeuristics`), and the WordPress "auto-approve a returning
    commenter" rule. A no-JS `<form method=post>` gets a `303` redirect back to
    its own page (`redirectTo`, validated against open-redirect and HTTP
    response-splitting) instead of a raw JSON body.
  - **`@cogenta/core`**: ten new error codes (`COMMENT_NOT_FOUND`,
    `COMMENT_BODY_INVALID`, `COMMENT_AUTHOR_INVALID`, `COMMENT_TARGET_INVALID`,
    `COMMENT_TARGET_CLOSED`, `COMMENT_PARENT_INVALID`,
    `COMMENT_PARENT_TOO_DEEP`, `COMMENT_STATUS_INVALID`,
    `COMMENT_RATE_LIMITED`, `COMMENT_SPAM_DETECTED`).
  - **`@cogenta/schema`**: `SITE_SETTINGS_REGISTRY` gains the `discussion`
    group (`discussion.enabled`/`moderationRequired`/`allowAnonymous`/
    `autoCloseDays`/`maxNestingDepth`/`notifyEmail`) — the site-wide defaults
    a collection or an entry can still override from `@cogenta/comments`'s own
    settings store (per-collection/per-entry overrides deliberately do not
    live in this registry, which is site/locale scoped only).
  - **`@cogenta/api`**: `shell-status-router.ts` gains `commentsPending` (a
    structural `CommentsQueueLike`, the same pattern `commerceOrdersPending`
    already uses) — additive, existing callers that never pass `comments` see
    `null` exactly as before.
  - **`@cogenta/theme-canonical`**: `renderCommentsSection` — the comment
    thread and its plain-HTML submission form, built through the existing
    `h()`/`text()` tree (no `raw()` escape hatch exists in this package, which
    is what makes "no visitor HTML ever reaches the page" structural rather
    than a habit to remember). Rendered by `renderEntryPage`
    (`@cogenta/cli`'s `theme-render.ts`) after the page's own `<main>`, on both
    the published page and the L16 page-builder preview's own draft render —
    except the preview, which never shows it (its `_ts` anti-spam field cannot
    be identical across two separate renders, so byte-identity there would be
    comparing two different legitimate values; `serve-builder.test.ts`'s
    fidelity test now documents this as a deliberate, checked difference).
    Contract B is untouched — no `comments` block, same reasoning L10 gave for
    `/search`.
  - **`@cogenta/import`**: `importWordPress` gains an optional `comments`
    option (a `CommentStore`) — when given, every importable WordPress comment
    is written with its real status (`wp:comment_approved` mapped to
    pending/approved/spam/trash, not just `'1'`), real threading
    (`wp:comment_parent`), on **both** posts and pages. Pages never imported a
    single comment before this — a real, independent bug, not something this
    fiche introduced, found while checking what the importer does today per
    the fiche's own instruction. Inline HTML a legacy WordPress comment form
    allowed (`<a>`, `<em>`, …) is stripped to plain text and reported (R3: no
    escape hatch). Absent `comments` keeps the pre-fiche-15 behaviour
    unchanged (approved-only, posts-only, the synthetic `comment` collection)
    for a caller that has not wired `@cogenta/comments` yet — its `post` field
    is a hard `relation` to the `post` collection specifically, so extending
    it to pages was never an option, only the real store is.
  - **`@cogenta/cli`**: `cogenta serve` mounts `/api/comments` (public POST +
    moderation queue), extends `readBody` to also parse
    `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (the no-JS form's own content type —
    every other route still only ever sends JSON), wires the comment thread
    into `theme-render.ts`'s page render, and passes a real `CommentStore`
    into every `importWordPress` call site (the terminal command and the
    admin's import screen alike). `cogenta doctor`/`serve` create contract F's
    tables idempotently, the same way commerce's tables are created — a site
    that never receives a comment never pays for them.
  
  Admin (`@cogenta/admin`, private, no changeset): a moderation queue screen
  (`/comments`, counters, bulk actions, search, reply-from-the-admin), a
  pending-count nav badge, `assist.moderate` reused verbatim as an indicator
  (never an action — its own closed `none`/`review` union already guarantees
  that, per the fiche's own instruction not to build a second decision path),
  a "Discussion" settings tab (previously a placeholder), and a per-entry
  comments toggle in the entry editor sidebar.

### Patch Changes

- [`8c98093`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/8c9809397c271c0f091ee8aaae140ac2a7c8e8f7) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Fix rich text (`richText` field) rendering when it carries a `media` node or an
  `internalLink` mark (ADR-0013): `cogenta serve` now resolves both before rendering, the
  same way it already did for a `collectionList` block's entries. Previously, an image
  placed inside a paragraph could make the whole page throw (`THEME_IMAGE_UNSUPPORTED`,
  the asset was never fetched), and an internal link inside prose always rendered a dead
  `<a href="#">` since its target was never looked up.
  
  An internal link whose target cannot be resolved — trashed, still a draft, or renamed
  away and gone — now renders as plain text instead of a dead anchor, on `@cogenta/theme-canonical`'s
  own recommendation for a stale link: never a 404, never a link to nowhere.

### Minor Changes

- [`32f5db9`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/32f5db932454aa35e586a4ffe144f909b0b773af) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Carry each placed block's identity into the rendered HTML, so a reader of the page can map
  a rendered element back to the block that produced it.
  
  Two data attributes, both written on every render rather than in a builder-only mode:
  
  - `data-block-key` — contract B's `_key` for the placed block, stamped by `renderPage`
    onto whatever element the block rendered to. It is written in one place, so no block
    renderer has to remember it.
  - `data-field` — written by a block renderer on the single element that carries one
    plain-text field's whole value (`hero`'s `title`, `quote`'s `author`, `cta`'s `text`, …).
  
  No element changed shape to get either one: the block snapshots differ by exactly these
  attributes and nothing else, so the outline, the styling and the layout are unchanged. Rich
  text and repeated list items deliberately carry no `data-field` — a document and a list are
  not a text node, and claiming they were would let a caller write a value it cannot address
  back.
  
  This is what makes the visual page builder (L16) able to show the real server-rendered page
  rather than a React approximation of it: one render path, one output, and the builder's
  fidelity test can assert byte equality instead of "close enough".

- [`e321f08`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/e321f089b14f5f116f28ab6eb2d2ffc0a43bc27d) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Give the canonical theme a real design system, and make `cogenta serve` actually send it.
  
  `src/styles/theme.css` is now three layers — `tokens.css` (the design system),
  `base.css` (document, accessibility, page frame, actions) and `blocks.css` (the twelve
  vocabulary blocks). Every value in all three is still derived from contract D's closed
  skin token set: spacing from `--cogenta-space-unit` and `--cogenta-space-scale`, type from
  the seven `--cogenta-font-size-*` steps `renderSkin` emits, colour from the seven colour
  tokens through `color-mix()` and relative `oklch()`. No token was added to the contract and
  no colour literal was added to the theme.
  
  **Two real bugs fixed on the way.** The stylesheet referenced `--cogenta-color-accentFg`,
  `--cogenta-color-mutedFg` and `--cogenta-font-baseSize`, but `renderSkin` kebab-cases token
  names, so the real properties are `--cogenta-color-accent-fg`, `--cogenta-color-muted-fg`
  and `--cogenta-font-base-size`. Every muted text colour, every primary button label and the
  entire typographic scale therefore resolved to nothing. A new test derives the expected
  property names from the skin and fails on any future misspelling.
  
  And `cogenta serve` sent the skin's generated custom properties but never the stylesheet
  that uses them, so every served page was styled by the browser's defaults with a skin
  defined and unused. It now inlines the theme's sheet — `@import`s flattened, comments
  dropped, whitespace squeezed — next to the skin's, and renders the same page frame
  `Base.astro` builds: a skip link, a site header with a home link, and a footer.
  
  **Dark mode, designed rather than inverted.** A `light-dark()` palette behind an
  `@supports` guard, with `color-scheme` declared so native controls follow. Elevation is
  expressed as lightness rather than shadow, the accent is lifted and its foreground
  consequently flipped to ink, borders become lighter overlays, and text stays off pure
  white. `design-system.test.ts` computes every one of those colours from the real stylesheet
  — resolving `var()`, `light-dark()`, `color-mix(in oklab, …)` and `oklch(from …)` — and
  asserts AA body contrast on fourteen pairs in both schemes.
  
  `Site.skinCss` is now `Site.styles`, and `assembleSite`'s last parameter with it.

### Minor Changes

- [`1c5efd2`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/1c5efd24572d6295e5e21f476637adf8ebc92819) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add the rendering layer: `@cogenta/render`, `@cogenta/theme-canonical` and `@cogenta/seo`.
  
  A theme reads content through an HTTP client carrying a read-only token, never through
  the data layer (ADR-0016), and the isolation is checked at install rather than documented
  and hoped for. A hostile-theme fixture proves the refusal against every route in: a bare
  `fs` alias, a subpath import, a template-literal dynamic import, `createRequire`, an
  import inside a `<script>`, and a `node:fs` alias smuggled through `package.json`
  `imports`. The inverse guard matters as much — a theme whose prose contains `don't`, a
  class named `process` and a commented-out import yields zero findings.
  
  The canonical theme implements the twelve blocks with no JavaScript at all, asserted:
  no script tag, no `on*` attribute, no `client:*` directive. Heading levels are read from
  the block vocabulary rather than restated, so a titleless `featureGrid` keeps its items
  at `h2` and no level is skipped. `consentRequired` suppresses even the provider
  thumbnail, because a thumbnail already leaks the visitor's IP.
  
  Skins validate as hard refusals: AA contrast on every declared pair with no epsilon on
  the threshold, a monotonic type scale, no missing and no unknown token, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured. A token value containing CSS syntax is refused — a
  skin is a shareable JSON file interpolated into a stylesheet, and without that check it
  is code rather than data.
  
  SEO derives JSON-LD from the schema, keeps `hreflang` reciprocal by construction, and
  blocks indexing on the working state as well as on draft status: a feed rendered from
  the working face ships unreviewed edits, which is the same leak as a draft and far
  harder to notice.
