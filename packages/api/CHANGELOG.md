## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`bcf646e`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/bcf646edfd9810a977161075e639bce760b91864) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add the agent administration interface (L5 task 9): "état, autonomie,
  budget, historique, traces".
  
  `@cogenta/agents`: `BudgetTracker` gains `usage(): BudgetUsage` — a
  read-only snapshot of the same three calendar-bucketed counters
  `checkCall`/`recordCall` already track, needed so an admin can show
  real spend against budget.
  
  `@cogenta/api`: a new `/api/agents` router (`createAgentsRouter`),
  structural against `AgentRegistryLike`/`TraceStoreLike`/`AuditLogLike`
  — no hard dependency on `@cogenta/agents`. Lists agents with their
  state/autonomy/budget/usage, enables/disables one, and reads its
  traces/history (empty list, not an error, when a trace store or audit
  log was not wired in).
  
  `@cogenta/cli`: `assembleSite` accepts an optional `agents` option;
  `/api/agents` is only mounted when it is supplied — no site constructs
  one today, so every existing deployment is unaffected (R2).
  
  `@cogenta/admin`: a new "Agents" screen — a list with enable/disable
  per row, and a detail panel showing recent traces and history for the
  selected agent.

- [`5d64afd`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/5d64afdb47dd5bfdbe06cb7895391b726fb22277) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add `GET /api/audit` (filterable by `actorId`/`action`/`collection`/`since`,
  paginated by `limit`) and `GET /api/audit/verify` (recomputes the hash
  chain, `AUDIT_CHAIN_BROKEN` naming the first mismatch on tampering) — both
  restricted to the `admin` role.
  
  `@cogenta/auth`'s hash-chained audit log (`createAuditLog`) existed since it
  was built as generic core infrastructure, but nothing wrote to it and no
  route read from it. `cogenta serve` is now its first writer: every
  successful login, logout, content create/update/delete/publish/restore and
  media upload/update/delete records an entry, at the transport layer rather
  than inside each service — one place, so no future write path has to
  remember to call it separately. Recording never blocks or fails the
  response it is auditing.

- [`a9a7553`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/a9a75531fe0b52fd9b55a3940c4abc337446cdc1) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add passkey registration and passkey login (WebAuthn), completing L2 task 3's second
  factor: TOTP with self-service enrolment, and now passkeys — the spec's primary sign-in
  method.
  
  `@cogenta/auth`'s `AuthService` gains four methods: `beginWebAuthnRegistration`/
  `completeWebAuthnRegistration` for adding a passkey to an already-signed-in account, and
  `beginWebAuthnLogin`/`completeWebAuthnLogin` for a usernameless sign-in — no account is
  named up front; the assertion's own credential id decides which one it is. The challenge
  each ceremony needs between its two requests rides in the same short-lived signed ticket
  the rest of this package already uses, extended with an optional `challenge` field and a
  nullable `userId` (unknown until login resolves it) — never a server-side store for
  something single-use that lives seconds. `AuthStoreOptions` gains `webauthn` (relying
  party config) and `issuer`, both previously accepted by `createAuthService` but silently
  dropped by the store-level factory.
  
  `@cogenta/api`'s `createAuthRouter` exposes this as
  `POST /api/auth/webauthn/{register|login}/{begin|complete}`. `cogenta serve` derives the
  relying party id and origin from `site.url` and the name from `site.name` — one more
  config field to keep, not a new one to add.
  
  `@cogenta/admin`'s login screen leads with "Se connecter avec une clé d'accès" over
  `@simplewebauthn/browser`'s `startAuthentication`, with password-then-TOTP as the
  fallback underneath. Passkey *registration* — adding one to an account — needs a
  settings surface that does not exist yet in the admin and is deferred to when that
  surface is built; the backend and API routes for it are already in place.

- [`a958ee1`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/a958ee12cee1130effb97e95d58fda219e153a4c) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add `@cogenta/api`: the permission layer, preview tokens, REST and GraphQL.
  
  Both transports run on one permission layer, as the lot requires. The hardest rule —
  the `public` role never reaches a draft, on any route, in either transport, whatever the
  query says — is enforced structurally rather than by condition: `canReadUnpublished`
  strips `public` from the actor's roles before looking at anything, so even a collection
  misconfigured with `update: ['public']` cannot become draft access.
  
  A preview token is the single deliberate exception, and it is scoped to one entry. That
  scoping is not free: `canReadUnpublished` is only told which collection is being read, so
  a grant for entry A would otherwise unlock every draft in it. Every path that returns
  entries filters each one through `previewCovers` — the list, the paginated connection,
  reads by id, and relation expansion including the batching loader.
  
  REST is a router over normalised request and response objects, with no HTTP framework and
  no listening socket, so it is tested without a server. Filters use a fixed vocabulary and
  values are coerced from the declared field kind, because a text comparison would rank
  `"10"` below `"9"`. GraphQL derives its schema from the collections, prints the same
  object it executes, and batches relation reads through a thirty-line dataloader written
  here rather than taken as a dependency.

- [`c522dda`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/c522dda594169b5148643726fbd41dbbf1c9a308) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add TOTP self-service enrolment, so a sensitive role with no second factor yet can set
  one up instead of being locked out.
  
  **Breaking within `@cogenta/auth`'s pre-1.0 `LoginResult`**: `passwordLogin` used to
  throw `AUTH_MFA_REQUIRED` for a role that needs MFA but has no factor configured. It now
  returns `{ status: 'totp_setup_required', ticket }` instead — the password was correct,
  and enrolling TOTP right now is the only thing standing between this attempt and a
  session. `AuthService` gains `beginTotpSetup(ticket)` (generates a secret and an
  `otpauth://` URI) and `confirmTotpSetup(ticket, code)` (verifies the code, confirms the
  secret, and signs the user in).
  
  The ticket a `totp_setup_required` result carries cannot be used to complete an ordinary
  `mfa_required` login, and vice versa: `purpose` is now folded into what the ticket's
  signature covers, not checked separately, so the two are a signature mismatch away from
  being interchangeable rather than a bug someone could introduce later.
  
  `@cogenta/api`'s `createAuthRouter` exposes this as `POST /api/auth/totp-setup` and
  `POST /api/auth/totp-setup-confirm`. `@cogenta/admin`'s login screen walks a
  `totp_setup_required` account through it — showing the secret to add to an
  authenticator app and confirming the first code — rather than showing a dead end.

- [`7a16841`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/7a168415e2fce628d4a835eb778be396104a2590) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add preview links: `POST /{collection}/{id}/preview` mints a one-hour,
  one-entry `PreviewGrant` token and returns the entry's real page path/URL
  alongside it (`site.url` + the collection's routing pattern). Any read of
  that one entry — `GET /{collection}/{id}` or `GET /-/by-path` — now accepts
  `?preview=<token>` together with `?state=working` to unlock exactly that
  entry's draft for whoever holds the link, and nothing else; a token for one
  entry never covers another, and a request with no token behaves exactly as
  it did before this change.
  
  The token is verified lazily, only when a `preview` query parameter is
  actually present, so an ordinary request never needs
  `COGENTA_PREVIEW_SIGNING_KEY` to be set at all — only minting and consuming
  a preview link do.
  
  `cogenta serve` passes `site.url` through to the REST router so a minted
  link is a ready-to-open absolute URL, not just a token the caller has to
  build a path for by hand.

- [`24b1745`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/24b174536c79a7b0f505e1ba4e70d5070fb14f6d) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - L9 task 12 ("Site du projet et playground"), the buildable slice the lot itself calls out: "commencer par une démo en lecture seule réinitialisée périodiquement."
  
  - `@cogenta/schema`: new `withReadOnlyStore(store)` — wraps any `ContentStore` so `create`/`update`/`delete`/`publish`/`unpublish`/`restore` refuse with a real `CONTENT_READ_ONLY` error while every read passes through unchanged.
  - `@cogenta/cli`: `runServe`'s `ServeOptions` gained a `readOnly` flag. Wrapped once, at the single point `serve.ts` constructs every `ContentStore` — both REST's `ContentService` and GraphQL's gateway share it, so neither transport can bypass the guard.
  - `@cogenta/api`: `CONTENT_READ_ONLY` maps to HTTP 403.
  - `@cogenta/core`: two new error codes — `CONTENT_READ_ONLY`, `PLAYGROUND_BLUEPRINT_UNKNOWN`.
  - `create-cogenta`: new `resetPlaygroundData()` — wipes and reseeds a blueprint's tables back to its own real demo content (`BLUEPRINT_CONTENT_PACKS`, unchanged, not a second parallel demo dataset). A real, tested, callable unit; scheduling it periodically is an operational decision for whoever deploys a read-only instance, not made here. `BLUEPRINT_CONTENT_PACKS`/`BlueprintContentPack` are now part of the package's public exports.
  
  Actual public deployment of a playground or the project site is explicitly out of scope: it is an irreversible action toward the outside world requiring resources only a human holds, per this project's standing autonomy rule.
  
  Also new: `@cogenta/project-site` (private, unpublished) — a small, real presentation site for the Cogenta project itself, built through the same content model and `renderPage`/`renderBlock` pipeline any installed site uses, with real content drawn from `docs/00-vision.md` and this session's own documentation.

- [`a958ee1`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/a958ee12cee1130effb97e95d58fda219e153a4c) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add the GraphQL API, generated from the collections and served over the same permission
  layer as REST.
  
  The schema is derived, not written: each collection produces one type carrying its
  declared fields and every system field of contract A, a cursor connection, a filter
  input, a pair of mutation inputs, and the five mutations — create, update, delete,
  publish and restore. A field added to a collection appears in the SDL, in the filter and
  in the mutation inputs at once, exactly as it already appears in `.cogenta/types.d.ts`.
  `renderSdl()` prints the very schema that answers the queries, so the published SDL can
  never drift from the executable one.
  
  GraphQL is a transport here, not a second engine. Queries go through the same
  `PermissionLayer` and the same filter vocabulary as REST — equality, comparison, `in`,
  `contains`, `exists`, `and`, `or` — and there is deliberately no escape hatch: no raw
  `where`, no `state:` argument, no way to name a draft. The state an actor reads is
  derived from the permission layer, so the `public` role cannot reach an unpublished
  entry by identifier, by listing, by filtering on `status`, through an alias or through a
  relation. A preview token is honoured for the single entry it names, checked per entry
  on every path including the batched relation loader.
  
  Pagination is by cursor. The `endCursor` of a page is the position of the last entry
  actually handed out, so a page whose entries were filtered in memory still continues
  where it stopped, and concurrent insertions cannot make a reader see an entry twice.
  
  Relation expansion is bounded, with a low default of two hops, because relations can be
  circular; the `depth` argument may lower the bound but never raise it. Related entries
  are resolved through a small hand-written dataloader that batches by tick and
  de-duplicates, so a page of twenty articles by two authors costs two reads rather than
  twenty.
  
  Errors rendered to a client carry a stable code, a fixed message and a fixed hint, taken
  from a table keyed by the error code. No bound parameter, no identifier, no SQL and no
  stack can reach a GraphQL response; the full error goes to the logger instead. Parse and
  validation errors are the one exception and are returned verbatim, since they run before
  any variable is coerced and can only quote the document the caller just sent.
  
  New direct dependency: `graphql` (MIT, the reference implementation maintained by the
  GraphQL Foundation). Cogenta needs a spec-compliant parser, validator and executor;
  writing one would be thousands of lines of security-relevant code for no gain, and every
  GraphQL client tool expects the real thing. The dataloader, by contrast, is thirty lines
  and is written here rather than added as a second dependency.

- [`3bc0872`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/3bc0872800001aace498f331abbd903c66f750e5) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add `/api/media` — upload, list, read, edit and delete media assets — over
  the `MediaStore` `@cogenta/core` shipped previously. `cogenta serve` now
  selects a storage driver (S3 or local, same registry the rest of the config
  already uses) and mounts the route alongside `/api/content` and `/api/auth`.
  
  Uploads travel as JSON with the file base64-encoded rather than multipart:
  the REST transport's own contract is "a body already parsed by the
  transport", and staying inside it avoids a multipart-parsing dependency for
  an admin-only upload path. The real file type is read from the bytes, never
  from the declared `Content-Type` or filename — the same check the image
  pipeline already used, moved into `@cogenta/core` in the previous release
  so this route can share it. An image whose bytes are not one of AVIF/WebP/
  JPEG/PNG is refused, naming what it actually is; an SVG upload is refused
  outright, per ADR-0017.
  
  Every route requires an authenticated actor — there is no per-collection
  permission model for media the way there is for content yet, so today's
  gate is "signed in at all," tightened once L4's agent tool permissions
  (contract C's `media.read`/`media.write`) land.

- [`2aa38b4`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/2aa38b4d466126c16afd0ac55febd35c7d163b00) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add `GET /{collection}/{id}/translations`, listing every live entry of the
  translation family an id belongs to (ADR-0014: one entry per language,
  linked by `translationOf`) — itself included, gated the same way `history`
  already is (only an actor who may read this entry's working state may
  enumerate its family).
  
  `buildSchemaDocument` accepts an optional second `site` argument
  (`{locales, defaultLocale}`), included in the document only when given —
  `.cogenta/schema.json`'s own build-time call is unaffected. `cogenta serve`
  now passes it through to `/api/schema`, so the admin can render a locale
  switcher without hardcoding assumptions about which locales a site has.
  
  Fixed along the way: `cogenta serve` was hardcoding `locales: ['en']`,
  `defaultLocale: 'en'` into the content service's routing options instead of
  reading `config.site.locales`/`defaultLocale` — a site configured for more
  than English silently only ever routed English. `translationOf` on create
  was already fully wired end to end (REST body → `ContentStore.create`); no
  change was needed there.

- [`aa878ea`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/aa878ea6766361219fe218e17741ce1d9d9ffd2f) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add `cogenta serve` — a real HTTP server over `@cogenta/api` and `@cogenta/auth`, and
  the `/api/auth/*` REST routes (`login`, `totp`, `session`) those two now share through
  `@cogenta/api`'s new `createAuthRouter`.
  
  The actor a request authenticates as comes from one function, `resolveActor` — a bearer
  token resolved through `@cogenta/auth`'s sessions, never trusted further than that — and
  both `/api/content/*` and `/api/graphql` call it, so there is exactly one answer to "who
  is asking", not a REST answer and a GraphQL answer that could drift apart.
  
  Collections load from `cogenta.schema.ts` next to the config file, the same
  dynamic-import convention `migrate.ts` already used for migrations. `serve` refuses to
  start without `COGENTA_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY` rather than inventing one, since a signing key
  that changes on every restart would silently invalidate every in-flight MFA ticket.
  
  Passkey ceremonies and TOTP enrolment are not in this router yet — both need a challenge
  held between two requests, which is deliberately out of scope for this pass and tracked
  for L2 task 3.
