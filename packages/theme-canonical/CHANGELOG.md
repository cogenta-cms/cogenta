### Minor Changes

- [`1c5efd2`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/1c5efd24572d6295e5e21f476637adf8ebc92819) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Add the rendering layer: `@cogenta/render`, `@cogenta/theme-canonical` and `@cogenta/seo`.
  
  A theme reads content through an HTTP client carrying a read-only token, never through
  the data layer (ADR-0016), and the isolation is checked at install rather than documented
  and hoped for. A hostile-theme fixture proves the refusal against every route in: a bare
  `fs` alias, a subpath import, a template-literal dynamic import, `createRequire`, an
  import inside a `<script>`, and a `node:fs` alias smuggled through `package.json`
  `imports`. The inverse guard matters as much — a theme whose prose contains `don't`, a
  class named `process` and a commented-out import yields zero findings.
  
  The canonical theme implements the twelve blocks with no JavaScript at all, asserted:
  no script tag, no `on*` attribute, no `client:*` directive. Heading levels are read from
  the block vocabulary rather than restated, so a titleless `featureGrid` keeps its items
  at `h2` and no level is skipped. `consentRequired` suppresses even the provider
  thumbnail, because a thumbnail already leaks the visitor's IP.
  
  Skins validate as hard refusals: AA contrast on every declared pair with no epsilon on
  the threshold, a monotonic type scale, no missing and no unknown token, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured. A token value containing CSS syntax is refused — a
  skin is a shareable JSON file interpolated into a stylesheet, and without that check it
  is code rather than data.
  
  SEO derives JSON-LD from the schema, keeps `hreflang` reciprocal by construction, and
  blocks indexing on the working state as well as on draft status: a feed rendered from
  the working face ships unreviewed edits, which is the same leak as a draft and far
  harder to notice.
