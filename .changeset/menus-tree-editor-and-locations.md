Menus gain a real editor (fiche `docs/plans/09-menus.md`):

- **Edit an item in place.** `PATCH /api/menus/{id}/items/{itemId}` now accepts `label`, `kind`, the target fields, `title` and `openInNewTab` — no more delete-and-recreate to fix a typo. Changing `kind` clears the previous target rather than keeping a value that no longer applies. `parent` is deliberately not accepted here; re-parenting still goes through `POST .../move`.
- **Bulk, transactional reorder.** `MenuStore.reorderItems` and `PATCH /api/menus/{id}/items` rewrite `parent`/`position` for any number of items in a single transaction, so a drag-and-drop or keyboard reordering session commits (or fails) as one unit — never a partially-rewritten tree if the network drops mid-session.
- **Menu locations.** `Menu` gains `location: string | null` (`byLocation`, `GET /api/menus/by-location/{location}`) — where a menu renders (`primary`, `footer`, …), carried by the menu itself rather than baked into a theme's name convention. `@cogenta/cli`'s `ThemeRenderOptions` gains `headerMenuLocation`/`footerMenuLocation`, resolved generically by location with a fallback to the legacy `main`/`footer` name lookup, so an existing site's navigation keeps rendering unchanged. `@cogenta/core` gains the `MENU_LOCATION_TAKEN` error code for the one-menu-per-location-per-locale rule.
- **Two new item kinds.** `taxonomy` (links to a term) and `home` (always resolves to `/`) join `entry`/`url`/`submenu-placeholder`.
- **Target health.** A menu item resolver may now report `health` (`published`/`draft`/`scheduled`/`archived`/`trashed`) for an `entry` item — computed only for an actor whose role already has draft access to the target collection, so a public read never learns that a draft exists. `cogenta serve`'s public render hides a dead `entry`/`taxonomy`/`home` link entirely rather than serving one.

All additions are backward compatible: `resolveEntry` gained a third `context` parameter and an optional `health` on its result, but a two-argument resolver still satisfies the type; every new field is optional or nullable on the wire.
