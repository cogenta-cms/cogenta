L9 task 9: real CLI surface for `generate types` and `skin list/validate/apply/generate`, plus `cogenta dev` as an alias for `cogenta serve`.

`generate types` is a thin wrapper around `@cogenta/schema`'s existing `renderTypeDeclarations`, writing to `.cogenta/types/schema.d.ts` by default. `skin list/validate/apply` are thin wrappers around `@cogenta/render`'s existing `validateSkin`/contract-D token groups — `apply` never writes a skin that fails validation.

`skin generate`'s underlying logic (`generateSkin`, the LLM→JSON→validate→retry-on-hint loop built for `create-cogenta`'s L9 task 7) is relocated from `create-cogenta` to `@cogenta/agents` (`@cogenta/agents`'s `generateSkin`/`GenerateSkinOptions`/`GenerateSkinResult`) so both the installer and `@cogenta/cli` can call the same implementation without either depending on the other — `@cogenta/agents` gains a dependency on `@cogenta/render` (the schema/validation it generates against), not the other way around. `create-cogenta`'s `skin-flow.ts` now imports `generateSkin` from `@cogenta/agents`; no behavior change.

`build`, `backup`, `upgrade`, `deploy`, `theme`, `agent`, and `generate schema`/`generate migrations` remain unbuilt — none has a real underlying capability to wrap yet (no Astro build wiring, no backup/restore mechanism, no deploy-target concept, no theme registry, no live `AgentRegistry` anywhere in the codebase, no schema-diff-to-migration generator). `cogenta <command>` for any of these falls through to the existing unknown-command usage message rather than a stub — see CLAUDE.md for the per-command reasoning.
