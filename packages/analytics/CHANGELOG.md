### Minor Changes

- [`95acedf`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/95acedf48920dba08e443e56ca4464bcfd394d34) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Analytics drill-down (fiche 27): pages, referrers, period comparison, custom
  date range, entry-editor stats, CSV export, and configurable, automatically
  purged retention — the gaps found against Jetpack Stats/Plausible/Matomo. No
  new field is collected: every addition is computed from the events row this
  package already wrote (path, referrer domain, device, daily-salted session
  hash), so the site's cookie-free, no-consent-banner posture is unchanged.
  
  **`@cogenta/analytics`**: `AnalyticsStore.getSummary` now returns
  `previousTotalViews`/`previousUniqueVisitors`/`viewsChangePercent` — the
  equal-length window immediately before the requested one, with `null` (never
  a misleading `0`) when there is no previous traffic to compare against.
  `getPageStats(path, window)` reports one page's views, previous-period views
  and rank among every path seen in the window — what an entry-editor sidebar
  needs, without pulling the whole top-N list. `purgeEvents(retainDays)` and
  `purgeSalts(retainDays)` delete rows past a configured retention; the events
  table is the largest table on a site with real traffic, and there is no way
  to disable purging outright, only to choose how long to keep.
  
  **`@cogenta/core`**: new config section `analytics.retainDays` (default 400
  days), resolved alongside every other site setting.
  
  **`@cogenta/api`**: `createAnalyticsRouter`'s `GET /api/analytics/summary`
  accepts a custom `?since=&until=` range (alongside the existing `?days=`),
  reports the period-over-period comparison, and — when the caller wires in
  `resolvePage` — enriches each top page with its entry's title and admin edit
  link. A new `GET /api/analytics/page?path=` answers the same admin-only stats
  for one page. `retainDays`, when wired in, is echoed back as `retentionDays`
  so the admin screen can show a real number instead of a promise.
  
  **`@cogenta/cli`**: `cogenta serve` wires the new `analytics.retainDays`
  config into a daily purge tick (same shape as the existing scheduled-publish
  tick — a sweep right away, then one every 24h) and resolves top pages against
  the site's real routes and permission-checked content gateway, so the summary
  screen can link straight to the entry in the admin.
  
  Purely additive: a site that never reads `/api/analytics/summary` behaves
  exactly as before.

- [`2c1af5d`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/2c1af5d8ec08b460ba80a2228ceca6f4ff89eef2) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Fiche 28 (tâches planifiées): a real scheduled-task registry and its admin
  screen — task 1 (registry) and task 2 (screen) complete and tested; task 4's
  concurrency-safe scheduled publication verified. `cogenta serve`'s own
  wiring of the registry, and the standalone `cogenta cron` command (task 5,
  for hosts with no permanent process), are **not done** — see below.
  
  - `@cogenta/schema`'s `ScheduledTaskRegistry` (`createScheduledTaskRegistry`):
    each task declares a name, description, interval and run function; the
    registry persists every run (`cogenta_scheduled_task_runs`) — last run,
    duration, outcome, error — so "did the trash sweep run last night" survives
    a restart rather than resetting with an in-memory timer. `overdue` is
    computed from that persisted timestamp (fiche 28's own named pitfall: a
    detector that lives in memory is blind exactly when a restart makes it
    matter).
  - `@cogenta/api`'s `createScheduledTasksRouter` (`GET /api/scheduled-tasks`,
    `GET .../{name}`, `POST .../{name}/run`, `GET .../queue`,
    `POST .../queue/{id}/retry`) — admin-only, thin read-through, "run now"
    never awaits its own audit write so a slow log never hangs the request.
  - `@cogenta/core`'s `QueueDriver` gains `list()`/`retry()` — the "file" section
    of the screen, and the way a failed maintenance job (fiche 24's queue) gets
    retried from the UI instead of a terminal.
  - `@cogenta/core`'s config gains `scheduler.mode` (`'internal'` |
    `'external-cron'`) and `backup.*` (interval/keep/dir) — resolved, defaulted,
    not yet consumed by `cogenta serve` (see below).
  - Admin: `/scheduled` (new nav entry, admin-only at the route level — R4, the
    nav link itself is not the gate) — task table with last run/duration/
    result/next run, an overdue badge, "run now" with a confirmation dialog for
    a `destructive` task (the trash sweep), a queue section with retry, and a
    pointer to the dashboard's own scheduled-content list rather than a second
    copy of it.
  
  **Genuinely not done, not just deferred quietly**: `cogenta serve` still
  drives scheduled publication, the trash sweep, the 404-log purge and the
  audit-integrity check on their own separate `setInterval`s, exactly as
  before this fiche — none of them are registered with the new
  `ScheduledTaskRegistry`. The registry and the admin screen above are real
  and fully tested against a registry populated by hand in their own test
  suites, but on a running `cogenta serve` today `/scheduled` would show an
  empty task list, because nothing calls `registry.register()` there yet.
  Wiring that in, and the `cogenta cron` command (task 5 — the fiche's own
  §8 leaves "deliver now or later" as an open decision), is real remaining
  work, not a rename or a config flag. Flagged here rather than left to be
  discovered later.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d72b40f`](https://github.com/cogenta-cms/cogenta/commit/d72b40f64ab5b98985a22d9daae34796a4638f45) Thanks [@georgesmomo](https://github.com/georgesmomo)! - Self-hosted, cookie-free page-view analytics — the one CMS feature category
  the audit found completely missing. No third party, no cookie, no personal
  data ever stored, consistent with R1 (no dure dependency on external
  infrastructure) and the project's privacy stance.
  
  **New package `@cogenta/analytics`.** One table (`cogenta_analytics_events`):
  timestamp, page path, referring **domain only** (never the full referrer
  URL), a device category reduced from the User-Agent (`desktop`/`mobile`/
  `tablet`/`other`, never the raw string), and a **daily-salted session hash**
  — never an IP address, never a cookie. The salt (`cogenta_analytics_daily_salts`)
  is minted once per UTC day and rotates every day, so
  `sha256(salt|ip|device)` for the same real visitor is a *different*, unrelated
  value on every new day: nothing in the stored data can link two days of the
  same visitor's traffic, even with full database access, because reproducing
  yesterday's hash needs yesterday's IP, which was never written down. The IP
  address and the full User-Agent are used only as transient inputs to that
  hash and to the device classifier — neither is ever persisted. A dedicated
  privacy test suite (`test/privacy.test.ts`) inspects the actual stored
  columns, not just the public types, to prove this. `createAnalyticsStore`
  aggregates views by day, top pages, top referring domains and device
  breakdown; a same-session rate limit (60 events/minute) drops abusive
  traffic silently rather than erroring.
  
  **`@cogenta/core`** gains one error code, `ANALYTICS_SALT_UNAVAILABLE`
  (an internal race-recovery failure, not expected in normal operation).
  
  **`@cogenta/api`** gains `createAnalyticsRouter`: `GET /api/analytics/beacon`
  (public, records one event, always answers `204` even on a malformed or
  rate-limited request — a public collection endpoint must never break page
  rendering) and `GET /api/analytics/summary` (`admin`-only, `?days=` window).
  
  **`@cogenta/cli`** wires both into `cogenta serve` and injects the collection
  tag into every rendered page. The tag is an invisible `<img>` pixel, not a
  `<script>`: the theme's rendered output already carries a hard "zero
  executable client JavaScript" property (enforced by a `serve.test.ts`
  assertion), so a script reading `document.referrer` was not an option. The
  referrer is instead read **server-side**, from the `Referer` header of the
  request that is rendering the page, and baked straight into the pixel's URL
  — no client code needed to capture it. The page builder's live-preview
  render includes the same pixel (rather than omitting it) specifically to
  keep its `<body>` byte-identical to the published page's, the invariant
  `theme-render-fidelity` depends on.
  
  The admin gains a full `/analytics` dashboard (hand-built SVG bar chart, no
  charting dependency — R9) and a "views this week" widget on the main
  dashboard, both `admin`-only like every other traffic-shaped view in the
  admin.
